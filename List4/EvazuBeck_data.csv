Thank you to Z Adventures (www.z-adventures.org) and Welcome to Socotra (www.welcometosocotra.com) for organizing this incredible event. I really look forward to taking part in the next Socotra Marathon, when travel becomes possible again.

I can't believe I got to run this marathon on Socotra Island, Yemen: this is how my 3-month adventure in Socotra began in 2020. Make sure you watch this video until the end to find out what EVEN BIGGER endurance event I'll be attempting in 2021 üòç  Adventure and endurance travel is going to be my next chapter on here!

MYDsjJivU8s,BEAUTIFUL Pakistani Wedding in the Mountains (Super Rare),"‚Üí  Join me for daily adventures on Instagram: https://instagram.com/evazubeck

Over a year ago, I was invited by a Wakhi family I befriended in the North of Pakistan to attend their eldest son's wedding... and make a film about it. It was a true honour, and rare opportunity to take part in the wedding celebrations of an ethnic community that lives in one of the remotest parts of Asia.

Congratulations once again to the lovely couple, Parveen and Pervaiz. May your life together be filled with happiness and good fortune. I will be forever grateful to the Posh family for embracing me as one of your daughters.",2021-01-03T11:32:14Z,32350,929,1146101,4536
gSKnFpQwKBA,I Became a Traditional Bride in Kosovo for 1 Day,"‚Üí  Join me for daily adventures on Instagram: https://instagram.com/evazubeck

I finally made it to Kosovo! I've been wanting to visit for the longest time, and got the perfect opportunity after meeting my Kosovar friend Amra on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/amra.skenderi). She introduced me to a unique wedding tradition that was once very common among the Bosniak Kosovar people. I decided to try it out for myself and travelled to meet with Amra, and her aunt Aziza, who is the last woman in Kosovo to create this traditional bridal look.

As you'll learn in the video, this bridal tradition is on the verge of extinction. I sincerely hope that Aziza finds other women capable of carrying it forward so that it can continue to flourish here in Kosovo.

P.S. I got 2 COVID-19 tests in the days directly before visiting Aziza in her village, and of course tested negative.

That road is NOT for the faint-hearted. But hey, I'm still here to tell the tale, so... all is well that ends well, right? üòú Albania is still one of those travel destinations where you can really go off the beaten path and dive into spontaneous adventures anywhere. This village, high in the mountains of Southern Albania, was the perfect destinations to explore the area.

I'd like to give a big THANK YOU to: Petrit and Dushe, our hosts, who welcomed us into their beautiful guesthouse, The House on Canyon (https://www.instagram.com/bujtina.mbi.kanion_guesthouse), with open arms. And of course my friends over at Drive Albania (https://www.instagram.com/drivealbania/), who showed me around Albania in their awesome Niva Lada 4x4. Can't wait to be back in 2021!

vQXOx9ECi5E,I Stayed with a Nomadic Family in the Sahara (Mauritania),"‚Üí  Join me for daily adventures on Instagram: https://instagram.com/evazubeck

The nomadic people of Mauritania live in one of the harshest environments on earth: the Sahara desert. It's an extremely wild and rugged place, and although their lives are very hard, our guide Abdou is in love with ""the poetry of the nomads"" in how they live their lives. He decided to take me and @Fearless & Far on an incredible journey to meet with one nomadic family that has lived in the desert for generations. 

Thank you to the best guide - Abdou - from the tiny Auberge Zarga in Chinguetti, Mauritania, for taking us out to the desert to meet Soliman and his family, in January 2020 (yes, this vlog is a little overdue üòÇ)

iFsLo3LLzqs,What travel is really like in 2020 (Serbia border crossing),"The travel industry has been affected dramatically by the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to share with you a perspective you probably don't hear very often unless you're a travel professional. With tourism being one of the biggest industries in the world, it employs 1 in 10 people around the globe, contributing 10% to the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across the entire industry.

‚Üí  Join me for daily adventures on Instagram: https://instagram.com/evazubeck 

Being a travel vlogger, I'm very privileged because I can still find ways to work and I can still produce YouTube videos (thanks for watching the ads, btw üòâ). But a lot of people who have given their lives to this industry aren't so lucky. Before you bash travel, please watch this video - because it offers a slightly different take on COVID lockdowns and travel restrictions.

I‚Äôve always loved the idea of travelling by cargo ship, but never expected that I would be taking one as an evacuation measure during a pandemic. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to film on most parts of the ship, but I did my best to show you as much of the journey as possible! Anyone out there inspired to jump on a cargo ship after COVID-19? :)

9ZzHt7sjI88,Living with a Family in a Mountain Village (5 WEEKS),"I will never forget this family. The Kebanys welcomed me into their home for for well over a month (end of April until end of May), in my last weeks on Socotra Island. I got to stay with them in their mountain village, Shibhon, and get to know them, their traditions and customs, and daily life. A lot of the culture in Socotra revolves around nature *and* your community: neighbours, friends, family members. It blew me away.

YKNnNX7QyJI,I Spent 24H on an Uninhabited Island (Rat-Infested),"In April, I got a chance to go on a trip to the uninhabited island of Darsa as part of my stay in Socotra. We had heard all sorts of myths and legends about this place: the most prominent being that it‚Äôs got a sizeable population of rats. We packed light because we treated the trip as a short, initial reconnaissance of the island, to evaluate potential tourism options here in the future! Between friends - it was far from what you'd get on a properly organised, commercial experience üôÇ

I've been to Karachi FOUR TIMES NOW, and I still haven't found the perfect biryani! Maybe that will finally change in this video?

Going horse riding on the beach at sunset, walking into abandoned buildings along MA Jinnah Road and encountering a few surprises along the way... But have I found the biryani of my dreams?!

506DaT8MmB8,What Western Media WON‚ÄôT Tell You About ISLAMABAD,"It's sad but it's true: if you say ""Islamabad"" to an average person in the West, they're likely to picture dusty streets, decrepit buildings and signs of oppression around every corner. I've been in this city for a while now, and I want to show you a different image: a side of Islamabad that no Western media channel represents. And while Islamabad has many different faces, in this vlog I will give you a flavour of the WESTERN side of the city!

njSbpcQoMYg,When Being a Travel Vlogger SUCKS,"This is my first video on YouTube where I take a closer look at the darker side of being a travel vlogger. It's a pretty honest and raw video, shot when I was under huge pressure to get back home for personal reasons, but couldn't. Luckily, it wasn't all bad, and by the end I had something of a revelation... 

I also just want to make it clear that I LOVE every moment of travel vlogging and think I'm extremely lucky to have this as a job. I'm grateful for this every single morning. But even if you do the things you love, after working 2 weeks non-stop for 14 hours a day, you have the right to be tired. I guess I just needed a day off so I could come back with the unusual energy :) Thanks for your support in these adventures!

Filmed in the beautiful mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan, Northern Pakistan. The town I was ""stuck"" in is called Gilgit, and I was there with an entire film crew, shooting a travel documentary which will come out sometime next year. Note that I shot this vlog myself, without the crew's assistance, haha!

_OuDxvpFtdg,These Pakistani Women Carpenters Are Fighting for Empowerment (at CIQAM Karimabad),"This is one of the most inspiring stories I have ever come across. Up in the mountains of northern Pakistan, a group of female carpenters is creating real social change. CIQAM, based out of Altit Fort (not Karimabad, as I incorrectly stated in the video!), trains and employs women and girls from local villages and impoverished backgrounds, offering them a chance to become financially and socially independent. Out of the 90 women working for CIQAM, 37 are carpenters. This initiative is truly ground-breaking in Pakistan's conventionally patriarchal society - but it comes at a cost.
